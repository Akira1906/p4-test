# Introduction

If you want to read steps for installing IPDK 23.01 or 23.07 from open
source and trying it out with a few simple P4 programs running on the
DPDK software switch, please follow this link and the instructions
there:

# Notes of old experiments that are only still around for possible future use

The link below IS ALMOST GUARANTEED NOT TO BE THE ONE YOU WANT.  It
describes several early failed, and successful, attempts at installing
IPDK and attempting to run P4 programs on the DPDK software switch.
See the previous section for the link you probably do want instead.
