# Introduction

These are my notes on attempts to install IPDK by following public
instructions in this repository:

+ https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk

I am experienced with the open source P4 development tools, and
Tofino's P4 development tools, but this repository is new to me, and I
would like to find or develop a Bash script that can install the code
from this repository in at least one of the ways it is intended to be
installed.

Note that I do not yet know all of the intended deployment
possibilities for the code in this repo yet.  That is also something I
am hoping to understand.


# Tries starting 2023-Feb-07

## try1: Attempt to install IPDK Networking Build, IPDK Native on Andy's macOS 12 system

Date: 2023-Feb-07

Hardware/OS is as described in section "Andy's macOS 12 system".

In macOS host system, created an Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Linux VM running
within VirtualBox, with all the latest updates as of the date I
attempted this install.

+ VM name: Ubuntu 20.04 ipdk net native try1

Started logged in as a non-root user named `andy`, but then did `sudo
bash` to start a bash shell running as `root`.

Followed instructions in file `build/networking/README_NATIVE.md`,
where I used the directory `$HOME/clone` for `<CLONE-PATH>`.

```bash
$ sudo bash
# mkdir $HOME/clone
# cd $HOME/clone
# pwd
/root/clone
# git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk.git
# cd ipdk
# git log -n 1 | head -n 10

# cd ..
# SCRIPT_DIR=$HOME/clone/ipdk/build/networking/scripts $HOME/clone/ipdk/build/networking/scripts/host_install.sh |& tee $HOME/clone/try1-out.txt
```

This got errors and quit very quickly.  See the file
[`try1-out.txt`](try1-out.txt).

It appears to be looking for files in `/git/ipdk` and subdirectories
underneath there, as if `<CLONE-PATH>` must be `/git` or else those
scripts will not work.  If `<CLONE-PATH>` has to be `/git` or nothing
works, then why not write the instructions with `/git` instead of
`<CLONE-PATH>`?

Looking at the `host_install.sh` script, it never mentions
`SCRIPT_DIR`, so that seems obsolete in the instructions.  It does
mention a `-d` command line option that might be what should be used.
I will try that below.

I have created a PR for the ipdk repo proposing simplifications to the
README_NATIVE.md instructions that should make them easier to follow
successfully: https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk/pull/376

## try5: Attempt to install IPDK Networking Build, IPDK Container on Andy's macOS 12 system

Date: 2023-Feb-11

Hardware/OS is as described in section "Andy's macOS 12 system".

In macOS host system, created an Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Linux VM running
within VirtualBox, with all the latest updates as of the date I
attempted this install.

+ VM name: Ubuntu 20.04 ipdk net container try5
+ RAM: 8 GB

Started logged in as a non-root user named `andy`.

```bash
$ mkdir $HOME/clone
$ cd $HOME/clone
$ pwd
/home/andy/clone
$ git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk.git
$ cd ipdk
$ git log -n 1
commit c38906d2a9f94200d3f99fc8fc24a56013a5115b
Merge: dbab9e2 8763e4f

    Merge pull request #374 from intelfisz/feat-update-storage-libs
    
    Update storage libs.
```

Now attempted to start following the instructions listed on this page:
https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk/blob/main/build/networking/README_DOCKER.md

```bash
$ cd $HOME/clone/ipdk/build
$ ./ipdk install
```

The last command above finished in a fraction of a second.

It created a directory $HOME/.ipdk and copies a file named ipdk.env
into it.

I already had a directory `$HOME/bin` in my shell's command PATH
before running the command above.  While running `./ipdk install`, it
also created a symbolic link named `$HOME/bin/ipdk` to
`$HOME/clone/ipdk/build/scripts/ipdk.sh`.

```bash
$ cd $HOME/clone/ipdk
$ ipdk install ubuntu2004
Loaded /home/andy/clone/ipdk/build/scripts/ipdk_default.env
Loaded /home/andy/.ipdk/ipdk.env
User changable IPDK configuration file is already defined at 
'~/.ipdk/ipdk.env'.
Changed runtime environment to: ubuntu2004
IPDK CLI is installed!
```

The last command above finished very quickly with the output shown.
It appeared to modify the file `$HOME/.ipdk/ipdk.env`.  I am not sure
if it changed anything else.

### Install docker on Ubuntu 20.04

I tried following these instructions for installing Docker on Ubuntu
20.04:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install --yes ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
$ sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install --yes docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

The IPDK install steps below require that you follow these "Linux
post-install steps" that enable a non-root user to run docker commands
without prefixing them with 'sudo', found here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

```bash
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ newgrp docker
$ docker run hello-world
```

### Continue with IPDK install

I was not behind a proxy, so did not attempt to do any of the proxy
configuration steps described.  They should be unnecessary for my
current install attempt.

```bash
$ cd $HOME/clone/ipdk
$ ipdk build --no-cache |& tee out-ipdk-build--no-cache.txt
```

The maximum extra disk space used during the above command I saw was a
bit under 8.5 GB, and since some intermediate files were removed
during the build, the final disk space was a bit under 7GB more than
what was used on the system at the start.  This was with 4 CPU cores
on an x86_64 system -- I am not sure whether it could be more disk
space if more CPU cores were used.

The RAM required was nearly 6 GB while compiling p4c, with 4 CPU
cores.  It would likely be about 1.5 GB per CPU core at the highest.

On Andy's macOS 12 system, it took about 33 mins to complete, with a 1
Gbps Internet connection.

At this point, there was a new docker image created, as shown below:

```bash
$ docker images -a
REPOSITORY                               TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ghcr.io/ipdk-io/ipdk-ubuntu2004-x86_64   sha-c38906d   8de06103d9f3   27 hours ago    1.69GB

```

However, I got an error when trying what appears to be one of the next steps, which is running `ipdk start -d`:

```bash
$ ipdk start -d |& tee out-ipdk-start-d.txt
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

```

It looks like maybe it got the wrong tag name somehow, with `none`
instead of the correct SHA digits `c38906d`?



Try something different this time, making some semi-educated guesses
about how I should set some environment variable values before running
the commands:

```bash
$ docker images

That looks somewhat promising.  What should I try next?

The instructions suggest this command to verify that there is a
process named infrap4d running:

```bash
root@c69587abe39a:~/scripts# ps -ef | grep infrap4d
root          47       1 99 18:53 ?        00:04:07 /root/networking-recipe/install/sbin/infrap4d
root         114      84  0 18:57 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto infrap4d
```

It looks like it is.  Let's try running the demo bash script to see
what happens:

That looks like success, as far as I can tell.

It appears that the infrap4d process is a combination of the DPDK data
plane that can have compiled P4 programs loaded into it, and also
includes a P4Runtime API server listening on TCP port 9559.

TODO: Is this true?

TODO: What else does infrap4d include?


## try6: Attempt to install IPDK Networking Build, IPDK Native on Andy's macOS 12 system

Date: 2023-Feb-20

Hardware/OS is as described in section "Andy's macOS 12 system".

In macOS host system, created an Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop Linux VM running
within VirtualBox, with all the latest updates as of the date I
attempted this install.

+ VM name: Ubuntu 20.04 ipdk net native try4
+ RAM: 8 GB

Started logged in as a non-root user named `andy`, but then did `sudo
bash` to start a bash shell running as `root`.

Followed my own slightly modified version of the instructions in file
`build/networking/README_NATIVE.md`, where I used the directory
`$HOME/clone` for `<CLONE-PATH>`.

```bash
$ sudo bash
# mkdir $HOME/clone
# cd $HOME/clone
# pwd
/root/clone
# git clone https://github.com/ipdk-io/ipdk.git
# cd ipdk
# git log -n 1

    Tests FIO in ptf tests
# cd ..
# $HOME/clone/ipdk/build/networking/scripts/host_install.sh -d $HOME/clone |& tee $HOME/clone/try6-out.txt
```

+ Time to complete: about 29 minutes
+ Maximum disk used at any point during the installation: a little under 7 GB
+ Final disk space used by the end of installation: a little under 5 GB

It appears to have succeeded, except for the last part where it tries
to create some TLS certificates.  The output of the install script is
in the file [`try6-out.txt`](try6-out.txt).  For the part that seems
to fail, see this line of output:

```
cp: cannot create directory '/usr/share/stratum/certs/': No such file or directory
```

It appears that this could have been fixed by uncommenting the
following line in the file, _before_ running the `host_install.sh`
script above:

```
#mkdir -p "${CERTS_DIR_LOCATION}"
```

Even if you did not do that, you can fix the situation at this time by
editing the file `/root/scripts/generate_tls_certs.sh` to remove the
`#` character at the beginning of that `mkdir ...` line.  Then run
this command:

```
/root/scripts/generate_tls_certs.sh
```

Below is my tailored version of the command for running the
`rundemo_TAP_IO.sh` script, based upon the directories I chose:

```bash
/root/clone/ipdk/build/networking/scripts/rundemo_TAP_IO.sh --workdir=/root |& tee $HOME/out-rundemo_TAP_IO.sh
```

If you see errors that look like this:

```
E20230220 18:39:24.025125  1801 credentials_manager.cc:100] Cannot access certificate/key files. Unable to initiate server_credentials.
E20230220 18:39:24.025245  1801 credentials_manager.cc:141] Cannot access certificate/key files. Unable to initiate client_credentials.
E20230220 18:39:24.046629  1801 gnmi_ctl.cc:396] Return Error: stub->Set(&ctx, req, &resp) failed with generic::invalid_argument: Invalid credentials.
I20230220 18:39:24.047788  1802 gnmi_ctl.cc:103] Client context cancelled.
```

Those occur while attempting to execute `gnmi-ctl` commands in the
`rundemo_TAP_IO.sh` script.  They occur because you have no created
TLS certificates as described earlier, so go back and do that.

With those certificates in place, `rundemo_TAP_IO.sh` started an
`infrap4d` process, loaded the compiled P4 program into it, added a
few table entries, and used a `ping` command to send packets through
it.  It all appeared to go successfully!

Ater these successful tests, I was also able to edit this file:

```
/root/examples/simple_l3/simple_l3.p4
```

to another legal P4 program that modified the TTL field in the IPv4
header to a different value than the value 64 it had when I used
`tcpdump` to capture the packets during a run of `rundemo_TAP_IO.sh`,
plus recalculate a correct IPv4 header checksum, and the modified
program was compiled and used when I ran `rundemo_TAP_IO.sh` again.
