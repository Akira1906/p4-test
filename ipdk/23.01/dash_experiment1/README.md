dash_experiment1 is an experimental subset of the P4 program in the
sibling directory 'dash', attempting to test a version of the .spec
file that never does 'mov' on entire header variables, which is
apparently not supported by the DPDK software switch.

See dash/README.md for more details on the original program from which
this was modified.

As of the current commit, the p4c-dpdk compiler output files checked
in were generated by p4c-dpdk built from the following version of the
https://github.com/p4lang/p4c repo source code, plus one patch given
below.

Steps to try out on a machine with IPDK container installed, after
starting the container:

In the base OS:
```bash
/bin/cp ~/p4-guide/ipdk/23.01/*.sh ~/.ipdk/volume/
/bin/cp -pr ~/p4-guide/ipdk/23.01/dash_experiment1/ ~/.ipdk/volume/
```

In the container:
```bash
cp -pr /tmp/dash_experiment1 /root/examples
cd /root/examples/dash_experiment1
/tmp/tdi_pipeline_builder.sh -p /root/examples/dash_experiment1 -s dash_pipeline.p4
/tmp/setup_2tapports_in_default_ns.sh
/tmp/load_p4_prog.sh -p /root/examples/dash_experiment1/dash_pipeline.pb.bin -i /root/examples/dash_experiment1/p4Info.txt
```
