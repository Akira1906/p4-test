dash_experiment1 is an experimental subset of the P4 program in the
sibling directory 'dash', attempting to test a version of the .spec
file that never does 'mov' on entire header variables, which is
apparently not supported by the DPDK software switch.

See dash/README.md for more details on the original program from which
this was modified.

As of the current commit, the p4c-dpdk compiler output files checked
in were generated by p4c-dpdk built from the following version of the
https://github.com/p4lang/p4c repo source code, plus one patch given
below.
