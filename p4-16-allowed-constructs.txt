The contents of this document have been compared against Appendix F
"Restrictions on compile time and run time calls" of the P4_16
v1.1.0-rc as of this git commit on 2018-Aug-11, and they appear to
match each other:

$ git checkout 015f9225ea022a337d986a9d2905f81bc6741217


TBD to add:
* extern function declaration
* extern function call


[*] Mark on things that are only allowed in, or most useful within,
    architecture model files.

The table below lists all types that may appear as members of headers,
header unions, structs, and tuples.  Note that int means an
infinite-precision integer, without a width specified.

The two-argument extract method on packets only supports a single
varbit field in a header.

This table has been reviewed and approved by the P4 language design
work group, but the latest p4c compiler as of 2017-Apr-11 does not
accept some of the types marked as 'allowed' inside of structs.  The
bmv2 behavioral model also does not yet support nested structs.

Type declarations for parser, control, package
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Type declarations for parsers, controls, and packages do not define
the behavior of those things, nor do they instantiate such a thing.
They only declare the thing's signature.

All of them have the general syntax like this, with the only
difference being the keyword 'parser', 'control', or 'package':

    [ <annotation> ] control <name> [ <type parameters> ] ( <parameters> );

Relevant symbols in grammar:
    parserTypeDeclaration
    controlTypeDeclaration
    packageTypeDeclaration

Examples, from file "very_simple_model.p4" in P4_16 spec:

   parser Parser<H>(packet_in b,
                    out H parsedHeaders);
   control Pipe<H>(inout H headers,
                   in error parseError,     // parser error
                   in InControl inCtrl,     // input port
                   out OutControl outCtrl); // output port
   package VSS<H>(Parser<H> p,
                  Pipe<H> map,
                  Deparser<H> d);
