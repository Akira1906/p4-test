# Introduction

This directory contains my personal notes on using
[`x4c`](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/p4), as described in [The x4c
Book](https://oxidecomputer.github.io/p4/book)


# Installation

You should see an interactive prompt while the script below attempts
to install rustup.  Press enter to proceed with the standard
installation.  If you have strong reasons to want to customize the
installation, you should not run this script.

```bash
./install-x4c.sh
```
