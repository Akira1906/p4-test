# Introduction

There are several different open source versions of a Python file
called `base_test.py` that have been published.  I believe they all
originated with this version:

+ File `proto/ptf/base_test.py` in the repository
  https://github.com/p4lang/PI

Another published version with some changes from the one above is:

+ File `tests/ptf/base_test.py` in the repository
  https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/fabric-p4test

The ones above were written for Python2.  The version in this
directory is adapted from those, with some changes, including:

+ only intended to work with Python3.  No attempt will be made to test
  it with Python2.


# Steps to create the file `base_test.py` here

Started by copying the first file above from commit SHA

That commit SHA is for a commit made 2021-Mar-11.  There have been no
